Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

Its instruction prompt gets long and confusing. It's hard to debug (which part failed?), difficult to maintain, and often produces unreliable results.\n\n**The Solution: A Team of Specialists**\n\nInstead of one \"do-it-all\" agent, we can build a **multi-agent system**. This is a team of simple, specialized agents that collaborate, just like a real-world team. Each agent has one clear job (e.g., one agent *only* does research, another *only* writes). This makes them easier to build, easier to test, and much more powerful and reliable when working together.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [LLM agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/llm-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Single Agent vs Multi-Agent Team**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Single[\"❌ Monolithic Agent\"]\n        A[\"One Agent Does Everything\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Multi[\"✅ Multi-Agent Team\"]\n        B[\"Root Coordinator\"] -- > C[\"Research Specialist\"]\n        B -- > E[\"Summary Specialist\"]\n\n        C -- >|findings| F[\"Shared State\"]\n        E -- >|summary| F\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#ffcccc\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style F fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/multi-agent-team.png\" alt=\"Multi-agent Team\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.1 Example: Research & Summarization System\n\nLet's build a system with two specialized agents:\n\n1. **Research Agent** - Searches for information using Google Search\n2. **Summarizer Agent** - Creates concise summaries from research findings","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Research Agent: Its job is to use the google_search tool and present findings.\nresearch_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"ResearchAgent\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"You are a specialized research agent.

This can be unreliable. A complex LLM might decide to skip a step, run them in the wrong order, or get \"stuck,\" making the process unpredictable.\n\n**The Solution: A Fixed Pipeline**\n\nWhen you need tasks to happen in a **guaranteed, specific order**, you can use a `SequentialAgent`. This agent acts like an assembly line, running each sub-agent in the exact order you list them. The output of one agent automatically becomes the input for the next, creating a predictable and reliable workflow.\n\n**Use Sequential when:** Order matters, you need a linear pipeline, or each step builds on the previous one.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [sequential agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Blog Post Creation Pipeline**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"User Input: Blog about AI\"] -- > B[\"Outline Agent\"]\n    B -- >|blog_outline| C[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    C -- >|blog_draft| D[\"Editor Agent\"]\n    D -- >|final_blog| E[\"Output\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffcccc\n    style C fill:#ccffcc\n    style D fill:#ccccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"h6Bcds7EBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/sequential-agent.png\" alt=\"Sequential Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1 Example: Blog Post Creation with Sequential Agents\n\nLet's build a system with three specialized agents:\n\n1. **Outline Agent** - Creates a blog outline for a given topic\n2. **Writer Agent** - Writes a blog post\n3. **Editor Agent** - Edits a blog post draft for clarity and structure","metadata":{"id":"h6Bcds7EBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Outline Agent: Creates the initial blog post outline.\noutline_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"OutlineAgent\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"Create a blog outline for the given topic with:\n    1.

Imagine a development environment where specialized \"agents\" handle specific tasks, collaborate seamlessly, and even learn from their experiences. This isn't science fiction; it's the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's about to change how you build software.\n\nAt its core, MAS involves a collection of independent, autonomous agents working together to solve complex problems. Unlike simple scripts, these agents are characterized by their autonomy, proactivity, reactivity, and the ability to communicate and negotiate with each other. This decentralized approach naturally lends itself to a modular design, much like microservices, making your codebase smaller, more manageable, and independently deployable.\n\nThe benefits for developers are profound. MAS can supercharge your development lifecycle. Think intelligent testing and debugging, where agents autonomously explore scenarios, identify bugs collaboratively, and even suggest fixes. Imagine automated code generation and refactoring assistance, freeing you from tedious boilerplate work.\n\nTangibly, this translates to enhanced scalability and maintainability. Breaking down systems into agents makes them easier to scale horizontally and reduces technical debt. You'll experience faster iteration cycles as independent agents allow for parallel development and quicker deployments. Collaboration improves, with agents acting as intelligent assistants, sharing insights and aiding onboarding. Crucially, the distributed nature of MAS leads to increased resilience and fault tolerance, making your systems more robust.\n\nEmbracing MAS is an investment in the future of your projects and your capabilities as a developer.

Imagine a development environment where specialized \"agents\" handle specific tasks, collaborate seamlessly, and even learn from their experiences. This isn't science fiction; it's the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's poised to fundamentally change how you build software.\n\nAt its core, MAS involves a collection of independent, autonomous agents working together to solve complex problems. Unlike simple scripts, these agents are defined by their autonomy, proactivity, reactivity, and their ability to communicate and negotiate with each other. This decentralized approach naturally fosters a modular design, akin to microservices, resulting in a codebase that is smaller, more manageable, and independently deployable.\n\nThe benefits for developers are profound, as MAS can significantly supercharge your development lifecycle. Envision intelligent testing and debugging, where agents autonomously explore various scenarios, collaboratively identify bugs, and even suggest fixes. Picture automated code generation and refactoring assistance, liberating you from tedious boilerplate work.\n\nTangibly, this translates to enhanced scalability and maintainability. Breaking down systems into discrete agents makes them easier to scale horizontally and reduces technical debt. You'll experience faster iteration cycles because independent agents enable parallel development and quicker deployments. Collaboration improves, with agents acting as intelligent assistants, sharing insights and aiding in onboarding new team members. Crucially, the distributed nature of MAS leads to increased resilience and fault tolerance, making your systems inherently more robust.\n\nEmbracing MAS is an investment in the future of your projects and your capabilities as a developer.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [Sequential Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)\n- [Parallel Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)\n- [Loop Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)\n- [Custom Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
